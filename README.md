## Usage

To install and run browbeat on your TripleO cloud

```

```

If you want to install and run workloads along with monitoring and visuzalization

```
infrared browbeat --install yes --config-file <filename> --monitor yes --visualize yes -e @<ansible_vars_file>
```
If browbeat is already installed, you can skip the --install flag or set it to no to skip the installation.

Passing the extra argument -e @<ansible_vars_file> is mandatory or the plugin will fail. A sample file is provided [here](vars/all.yml)
